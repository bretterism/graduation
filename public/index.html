			<h1 class="header-block">I'm Graduating!</h1>
			<div class="content">

			<p>It has been a long time since I began my college education,
			but the time has finally come. I am graduating! Thank you everyone
			who have given your love and support throughout all these years. I
			couldn’t have made it without you.</p>

			<p>When I first started college, I really had no idea what I
			wanted out of it. I enrolled at Lane Community College with a major
			in graphic design. I picked this major because it was a way for me
			to enter web design. After about a year and a half, I had realized
			that graphic design was not for me. I was pretty bad at drawing,
			and  wasn't really enjoying my classes.</p>

			<p>Around this same time, I had been spending most of my evenings on
			projects in the garage. I had built potato guns, a table with an
			interactive screen for the top, and even gotten into fixing video
			game consoles and other electronics to make a profit. One day at
			work I was telling my co-worker how I felt about my schooling, to
			which he replied, “Why don't you go into engineering?”</p>

			<p>It didn't occur to me before then that I could actually make a
			career out of the things I love doing. After a few weeks of
			consideration, I decided to switch career paths to pursue
			engineering.</p>

			<p>I spent the next few years at LCC to improve my math skills. At
			that point they were below even the college level of algebra
			required by most majors. I gradually learned more and more until I
			got through basic calculus. At this point it was finally time to
			move to Corvallis and attend Oregon State University.</p>

			<p>Moving to Corvallis was one of the biggest leaps in life. I was
			moving out of my parents house to live in a different town, with
			no roommates, where I knew nobody, in order to attend a
			university. I felt very intimidated for the first few months. I
			wasn't really sure if I could make it in this town. After about a
			month of not establishing any relationships, I finally broke out
			of my shell and got a hold of the one person I sort of knew. She
			was a sister of a friend of mine, and at that point I was wanting
			nothing more than to make a friend. I met Kathleen at a coffee
			shop on campus for lunch. It was awkward to say the least, but I
			was thankful just to have a friend. All of you know where that
			relationship has blossomed.</p>

			<p>After four years in Corvallis, I have come out of my shell,
			made lots of friends, got married, and am about to graduate. There
			were many times when I felt like giving up. But between my
			friends, family, and God always encouraging me I have reached the
			end of my goal. I thank everyone again who has helped me get to
			this point, and I am very excited to have made it!</p>

			<h1 class="header-block">Where We Are Going</h1>
			<div class="content"> <p>We are moving to the Portland area! A
				month after graduating, I will start my new career path at
				Huron Consulting Group. They work closely with hospitals and
				health care systems to provide software custom
				tailored to their needs. I will be working mostly with
				databases and also in customer relations. I start in mid July,
				when they will be sending me to Chicago for training. After a
				few weeks of training I will be back in Oregon and working
				full time in Lake Oswego.</p>

				<p>Before we head up to Portland, Kathleen and I will be
				taking some time off so that we can grow closer together, and
				enjoy some vacation time. We are currently planning a backpacking
				trip in the Eagle Cap Wilderness in eastern Oregon. We are
				preparing for a 5 day, 40 mile trip full of excitement and
				adventures!</p>
